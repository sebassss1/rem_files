    Summary: "Provides a global storage of lockable contexts. Each lockable context
      stores a list of lock requests which can be managed as needed.\n Each lockable
      context must be referenced separately by storing the result of ```\nBasisLocks.LockContext
      myLock = BasisLocks.GetContext(\"MyLockId\");\n```\n This returns a List-like
      wrapper to the provided lockable context.\n This context is globally unique,
      and if other unrelated logic attempts to retrieve the same context, they will
      get an equivalent wrapper.\n All lock contexts are thread-safe.\n Once you
      have a lock context, you can do whatever you want to do with it like you would
      any other List.\n To add a lock, use ```\nmyLock.Add(nameof(MyClass))\n```\n
      To remove a lock, use ```\nmyLock.Remove(nameof(MyClass))\n```\n To check if
      a lock is occupied ```\nif (myLock)\n```\n You can add a lock multiple times.
      For each lock added, that same number of locks must be removed before it is
      considered unlocked."

    Summary: " Checks if the given `Handle` \"points to\" the given `Identity`.\n\n
      SECURITY NOTE:\n\n All of the following must be true to consider a handle associated
      with a\n given peer:\n * `HandlePointsToIdentity(handle, identity)` returns
      `true`\n * `identity` points to `handle` through some other mechanism (for
      example,\n   a peer is authenticated on `identity` and has requested `handle`
      to be\n   displayed to other players).\n\n If you only establish that `handle`
      -> `identity` without also ensuring\n ensuring that `identity` -> `handle`,
      then its possible for Bob to\n point `bob.com` to Alice's handle, and make
      Alice appear as `bob.com`\n without Alice's consent. Likewise if you *only*
      establish that\n `identity` -> `handle`, then bob could point their identity
      to `alice.com`\n and masquerade/spoof themselves as alice. This is why its
      *very* important\n to establish a bidirectional mapping: `handle` <-> `identity`."
